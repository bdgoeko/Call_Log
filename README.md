# Call_Log
My plan is to create a web interface to the call history, with the ability to add my own "Caller ID" for each call. And have the ability to call another script if a new call is recieved. (Ie be able to email or send a message of some sort, with the personal caller id info.)

So there is a script to retrive the call log from the OBIHAI OBi100, and add it to a mysql database, and trigger another script if there are new calls.

Then a web interface to view the calls, and view the caller id info, and add caller id info.

That is the plan.

As for June 2015, I have a ruby script that will retrieve and parse the data from the first page of the "Call History" of the OBi100.
